<h1>Netis WF2419I Router Hacking Diary</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>I had an old (2014-ish) and cheap (if I recall correctly it cost me around 15-20 â‚¬) Netis WF2419I <a href="http://www.netis-systems.com/Suppory/de_details/id/1/de/181.html">[1]</a> router collecting dust in a cabinet at home. Its performance has always been lackluster with the WiFi connection dropping and restarting every few minutes. I bought it to serve as a guest AP for my dorm while I was studying in Padova. It worked dutifully for a few years there but, after I moved, I've never used it any more and switched to a whole different setup (which I hope to describe in another post) with more powerful hardware. </p><p>This router was almost forgotten, until I read an excellent article by George Hilliard <a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/">[2]</a> about hacking Reolink cameras. I had no plans to use this device in any case, given that it is rather old and crappy. So reading the article was enough to spark my interest in trying to reverse engineer and add as much new functionality as possible to this piece of hardware (or, perhaps, should I say "junk"?). It surely won't be missed if something goes wrong in the process. </p><p>First off I set myself some goals to keep me on track: </p><ol><li>Open the router and identify chipset, RAM, FLASH size and serial port </li><li>Dump the flash contents and inspect them </li><li>Rebuild a bootable image from the extracted contents and flash it </li><li>Setup a working buildroot image and compile a statically-linked busybox </li><li>Compile a (hopefully working) custom kernel for the device </li></ol><p>As you can see, each goal somewhat depends on the previous one. Moreover, it's my firt time that I try something like this and some of those goals are not easy. Murphy's law gets you every time and I have encountered many roadblocks during this journey. In writing, I will not spare any of the details, including the <strong>MANY</strong> failed attempts. That's why I'm calling this page a diary. </p><p>At the time of writing I'm quite far from completion and I have somewhat abandoned the project. I may reboot it in the future so, perhaps, I might decide to split this post into a series. </p><p>All the code and raw notes I have produced are available on <a href="https://github.com/electricant/netis-wf2419-router-hacking">GitHub</a>. </p><h2>Opening up the Device &amp; Talking to the Serial Port</h2><p>Opening the device and finding the serial port has been the easy part. Actually, before rushing to the screwdriver to open the chassis, I searched for the FCC ID of the device on the back of the unit. Every RF device needs to be FCC certified to be sold and imported in the US <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/equipment-authorization-procedures">[3]</a> and this router is no exception. I found the FCC ID on the lower-right corner of the label: <strong>T58WF2419R</strong>. By searching for this ID on the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid">official FCC website</a> or on <a href="https://fccid.io/T58WF2419R">fccid.io</a> I already had access to many low-level details about the router, including internal photos, without the need to open it. Not that opening it was a big deal. The warranty is already expired so no worries. </p><p><figure> <a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/fcc_id_label.jpg">  	<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/fcc_id_label.jpg"/>  </a>  <figcaption> The FCC ID, as seen on the label.</figcaption>  </figure>  </p><p>Stop wandering around the FCC website reading test reports! Given my goals, I need access to the flash chip so I have to open the device anyway. This was as easy as just removing the two screws on the bottom side (one is hidden by the mandatory 'warranty void if seal is broken' sticker, about which I couldn't care less) and popping open the case. </p><p>With the case open, the following components appeared before me onto the sea of green of the board and are highlighted in the picture below: </p><ul><li>Realtek RTL8196C - the main router chipset</li><li>Realtek RTL8192CE - WiFi chipset</li><li>Winbond W25Q32FV - 32Mbit (4MB) SPI FLASH memory</li><li>ESMT M12L128168A - 2M x 16 Bit x 4 Banks (16MB) SDRAM</li><li>A few test points, probably for JTAG and UART access</li></ul><p><figure> <a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/components_labelled.jpg">  	<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/components_labelled.jpg"/>  </a>  <figcaption> Router board with main components labelled.</figcaption>  </figure>  </p><p>The usual first step is to see if a serial port is exposed somewhere on the board in order to have access to a shell on the device. As shown in the picture above, just by looking at the board, I already identified a few suitable testpoints. Just to be sure and also for future use, I looked up on my favourite search engine for the main router chipset datasheet. As expected, somebody (thank you!) released a confidential copy of the document <a href="https://lost-contact.mit.edu/afs/sur5r.net/service/drivers+doc/Realtek/RTL8196C%20Datasheet.pdf">[4]</a>. I neglected all the other details for the moment and scrolled right-ahead to the pinout, looking for a serial port of some kind. </p><p><figure> <a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/chipset_pinout.png">  		<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/chipset_pinout.png"/>  </a>  <figcaption>  	Realtek RTL8196C chipset pinout with serial port pins highlighted. </figcaption>  </figure>  </p><p>In the above picture I cut the relevant part of the datasheet, showing the pinout of the chip. In the bottom-right part there are two pins (pin 36 and 37) labelled <strong>UART_RX/GPIOA7</strong> and <strong>UART_TX/GPIOB0</strong> respectively. Those pins can be configured either as GPIOs (for controlling the router LEDs etc.) or as a serial port. I traced those two pins with a multimeter and they are routed to the unpopulated header labelled <strong>J1</strong>. Most likely, they are the serial port I'm looking for. Time to solder a pin header and connect a TTL to USB adapter and see who's there. But HEY! Wait! What's the baud rate? A quick check with an oscilloscope revealed it's <strong>38400bps</strong>. I know using an oscilloscope for this task it's a bit of an overkill, but I had one on hand so why not using it? By the way, some trial and error works too. </p><p><figure> <a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/pin_header.jpg">  	<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/pin_header.jpg"/>  </a>  <figcaption> Pin header soldered to <strong>J1</strong>.</figcaption>  </figure>  </p><p>After connecting a TTL to serial adapter and issuing </p><pre><code>$ screen -L /dev/ttyUSB0 38400 </code></pre><p>When the router boots, the following messages appear on my terminal: </p><pre><code>=============================

Isn't it? </p><p>Now that I have grabbed some basic information about the system it's time to move on and see what's inside the flash chip. </p><h2>Dumping The Flash Contents</h2><p>I had already identified the chip by visual inspection while opening the router: it is a Winbond W25Q32FV chip. Time to download its datasheet <a href="https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25q32fv%20revi%2010202015.pdf">[5]</a> to get the pinout and connect it to my beloved Bus Pirate <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate">[6]</a>. The Bus Pirate is a small and useful board to talk to and interact with digital stuff. Out of the box it supports the following interfaces: 1-Wire, 2-Wire, 3-Wire, I2C, SPI, JTAG, UART and LCD. Alternatively, the GPIO pins can be directly controlled and many more protocols can be added using aftermarket firmware images since it is all open source. </p><p><figure> <a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_pinout.gif">  	<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_pinout.gif"/>  </a>  <figcaption> Winbond W25Q32FV flash chip pinout.</figcaption>  </figure>  </p><p>Now that I know the pinout of the chip, I have to figure out how to connect it for <strong>flashrom</strong> <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/Bus_Pirate">[7]</a> to read it. I'll try In-System Programming (ISP) <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/ISP">[8]</a> first since it is much quicker and does not require reworking the board every time I have to read or write the flash contents. If this won't work the only solution is to desolder and resolder the flash chip from the board every time. This is time consuming and I'd like to avoid it at all cost. </p><p>By means of a quick reverse engineering of the traces around the chip, I found out that pin 3 and pin 7 (<strong>/WP</strong> and <strong>/HOLD</strong> respectively) which, according to <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/Bus_Pirate">[7]</a> should be connected to 3.3V on the bus pirate, are already tied to the VCC pin (pin 8). Therefore, only 6 out of the 8 required wires have to be connected. </p><p>After twenty minutes spent with my trusty soldering iron and a piece of an old ATA cable (the 80-wire version which uses smaller conductors) and I have created a nice little connector ready to be plugged into the Bus Pirate socket. </p><p><figure> <a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_buspirate.jpg">  	<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_buspirate.jpg"/>  </a>  <figcaption> Bus Pirate ISP connection to the flash chip.</figcaption>  </figure>  </p><p>To check for a successful connection I issued the following command: </p><pre><code>$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=2M

The image contains some LZMA compressed data, probably kernel and bootloader, and a squashfs file system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS">[10]</a>. This time binwalk recursively extracted those files and what I got was in fact a kernel (version 2.4.18 of course), some certificates and the contents of the root file system. I was now able to inspect and modify the image contents as I please. The expert reader (or my future self if he learned something from this endeavour) may already have noticed the first mistake here. If nothing above looks wrong fasten your seat belt we're going deep down a rabbit hole. </p><h2>Rebuilding the Flash Image and First Roadblocks</h2><p>This is the root folder structure of the extracted image: </p><pre><code>$ ls -l _firmware_orig.bin.extracted/squashfs-root/

What is going on? I decided to tackle one issue at a time. </p><p>First of all is the squashfs file system backwards-compatible? Apparently, SquashFS v4.0 moved to a fixed little-endian format (even for big-endian systems). Given the differences, the odds of the new image booting are already quite low. For the sake of science I decided to test the new image anyway. </p><pre><code>$ cp ../firmware_orig.bin firmware_pwned.bin

I needed an older version of squashfs, supporting setting a different endiannes. Is there a different/lower version of squashfs-tools in the Debian repos? Of course not. I had to compile it my own. Who cares I'm already used to that. The first thing I did was to download the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/squashfs/files/squashfs/squashfs2.2-r2/">squashfs sources for version 2.2-r2</a>. And once again the stock sources cannot be compiled with gcc 10. I learned, after trial and error, that this is due to different gcc behaviour and due to some symbols moved to different header files. To get this squashfs-tools version compile on my system I had to apply the following changes: </p><pre><code>$ diff -u squashfs2.2-r2/squashfs-tools squashfs-tools

However, the router is still stuck in a bootloop. A quick check confirmed that the size of the final flash image fits in the flash chip, so the file system size was not the issue. It was a symptom of the issue instead: what was still missing was the correct compression algorithm for mksquashfs. The version 2.2 of mksquashfs does not support lzma compression by default. A working copy of squashfs-lzma <a href="https://squashfs-lzma.org/">[12]</a> was needed. I was fed up of blindly trying stuff until something works, so I downloaded the GPL code <a href="http://www.netis-systems.com/Suppory/gpl.html">[13]</a> (thanks Richard Stallman) for my router model and started inspecting the package contents to find some clues about how the flash image is built. </p><h3>GPL Code is Fun</h3><p>Inside the package I found the directory <strong>GPL_Code_RTL/rtl819x-sdk-v1.2/AP/squashfs-tools</strong> containing some sources for mksquashfs. After copying it somewhere else to preserve the original files, I had to patch the code inside the new directory in a similar fashion as SquashFS 2.2-r2. </p><pre><code>$ diff -ru squashfs-tools-orig squashfs-tools/

To avoid manually entering a series of commands every time I want to build a new image, I created a small script available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/electricant/netis-wf2419-router-hacking/blob/master/firmware.extracted_new/mkimg.sh">[14]</a>. </p><h2>Compiling Software and More Roadblocks</h2><p>This page is getting long already. Let's recap the ultimate goal: compile a custom kernel for the device. To do so, I need a working compiler for the architecture. This process is streamlined by buildroot: <em>a set of Makefiles and patches that simplifies and automates the process of building a complete and bootable Linux environment for an embedded system</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buildroot">[15]</a>. Buildroot downloads and builds the toolchain and utilities it needs for compiling software for the target architecture, applies custom patches to the sources, compiles the software and assembles the final bootable image. </p><p>To test the compiler is working, I decided to build a new version of busybox with some added functionality using buildroot. So, the first thing I did was to clone the latest stable buildroot release (2020.08.1 at the time of writing) with </p><pre><code>$ git clone git://git.buildroot.net/buildroot $ cd buildroot $ git  
checkout 2020.08.1 </code></pre><p>Then, I tried to build a statically-linked busybox executable with some nice additions to the stock one on the router (such as telnet) using <strong>MIPS (big endian)</strong> as the target architecture and the stock <strong>Generic MIPS32</strong> target architecture variant for buildroot. The command I used are the following: </p><pre><code>$ make menuconfig  
/*  
   Select the desided architecture and build options  
   Especially:  
	Target options -&gt; Target Architecture -&gt; MIPS (big endian)  
	               -&gt; Target Architecture Variant -&gt; Generic MIPS32  
	Build options -&gt; libraries -&gt; static only  
*/  
 
$ make busybox-menuconfig  
/*  
   Enable telnetd and disable all the stuff we don't need to make the  
   busybox executable small  
*/  
 
$ make  
/* have a coffe break */ </code></pre><p>After a few minutes, I found the compiled busybox executable in <strong>buildroot/output/target/bin</strong>. I copied it as <strong>busybox_p</strong> (to avoid confusion with the original executable) to the extracted firmware image and created a symlink to it named <strong>telnetd</strong>. I rebuilt the image as I did many times, flashed it and let the router boot. Sadly this was the result when running the new executable from the serial terminal. </p><pre><code># busybox_p  
Illegal instruction  
# telnetd  
Illegal instruction </code></pre><p>Why can't this stuff just work? Maybe the endianness of the executable is wrong, all in all I just guessed it. In the extracted firmware image directory on my PC I ran: </p><pre><code>$ file busybox  
busybox: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, stripped  
$ file busybox_p  
busybox_p: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped </code></pre><p>So the endianness was indeed correct. However, according to the chipset datasheet&#8239;<a href="https://lost-contact.mit.edu/afs/sur5r.net/service/drivers+doc/Realtek/RTL8196C%20Datasheet.pdf">[4]</a> and some other web resources, the illegal instruction the device was encountering may be due to the core which is a RLX4181 Lexra architecture&#8239;<a href="https://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/Lexra">[16]</a>, a variant of the MIPS32 architecture lacking the <strong>lwl, lwr, swl</strong> and <strong>swr</strong> instructions, covered by an US patent. </p><p>Time to dig into the search engine once again. The following links seemed to point to some useful code: </p><ul><li><a href="https://gist.github.com/hackpascal/c07dd5e3745f90b45e5ed6c1e86fde41">hackpascal/0001-binutils-2.24-add-lexra-support.patch</a></li><li><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/t/working-realtek-soc-rtl8196e-97d-97f-in-last-master/70975">Working Realtek SoC RTL8196E 97D 97F in last master - For Developers - OpenWrt Forum</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/rlx-router/openwrt-rtl8196c">rlx-router/openwrt-rtl8196c</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/rlx-router/linux-rlx-upstream">rlx-router/linux-rlx-upstream</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/shibajee/buildroot-rlx4181">shibajee/buildroot-rlx4181</a></li></ul><p>The last link contains a complete buildroot repository allegedly supporting the RLX4181 architecture. I added it to my buildroot folder, cleaned it and rebuilt it once again: </p><pre><code>git remote add https://notabug.org/shibajee/buildroot  
git remote add -f rlx4181-notabug https://notabug.org/shibajee/buildroot  
git checkout rlx4181-master  
make clean  
make menuconfig  
/* Select the correct architecture and build options */  
make -j4 </code></pre><p>After a while the executable files were ready. I ran <strong>objdump -D</strong> on the output executables, grepping for the instructions which are not accepted by the processor. Those commands did not turn any result. </p><pre><code>objdump -D root/bin/busybox_p | grep lwl  
objdump -D root/bin/busybox_p | grep lwr  
objdump -D root/bin/busybox_p | grep swl  
objdump -D root/bin/busybox_p | grep swr </code></pre><p>Now I was really confident that this time everything will have worked as expected so I rebuilt the flash image and flashed onto the chip. Sadly I was greeted again by the darn <strong>Illegal instruction</strong> message. </p><p>I was starting to suspect that the error was due to the wrong kernel headers version. The actual kernel header files for the Linux version running on the device are available in the GPL code package. So, within my buildroot folder, I issued: </p><pre><code>make uclibc-menuconfig </code></pre><p>To edit the uclibc .config file and set a different directory to fetch the kernel headers. </p><p>Pointing uclibc to the original (and quite old) kernel headers did not work either. This time I was unable successfully compile buildroot because I got a bunch of undeclared identifiers in many libraries. This is probably due to the kernel headers lacking the symbols required by the new software I was trying to compile. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Eventually this has been too much for me. I'm calling it quits here. Porting newer software to the older kernel headers to fix the compilation errors is a tedious job. Another option could be to port a newer kernel to the device, but all the kernel sources available on github seem to compile successfully but do not boot properly. </p><p>Alternatively, I could try to use an older buildroot version. I have no idea if there is any buildroot version compatible with the Linux kernel version 2.4. This can be easily fixed by searching within the git repository. However, I will have to manually port the binutils patches to correctly compile software for this unorthodox MIPS architecture. And this again is tedious. </p><p>I think the effort required to go further with this project is becoming too much and it is not worth it any more. Some progress has already been made by the OpenWrt folks albeit on a different processor revision (see links in the previous section) so I may reboot this project in the future. </p><p>All in all, I learned a lot already and no electronic devices were harmed in the process. So, even though I hit only 3 out of the 5 objectives I set at the start, I'm quite satisfied. It was still a valid learning experience. It's time to try to hack another router, maybe I will be luckier this time (stay tuned). </p><h2>References</h2><p>[1] <a href="http://www.netis-systems.com/Suppory/de_details/id/1/de/181.html">Netis WF2419I</a> </p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/">Hacking Reolink Cameras For Fun and Profit</a> </p><p>[3] <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/equipment-authorization-procedures">FCC Equipment Authorization Procedures</a> </p><p>[4] <a href="https://lost-contact.mit.edu/afs/sur5r.net/service/drivers+doc/Realtek/RTL8196C%20Datasheet.pdf">RTL8196C Datasheet</a> </p><p>[5] <a href="https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25q32fv%20revi%2010202015.pdf">W25Q32FV Datasheet</a> </p><p>[6] <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate">Bus Pirate - Dangerous Prototypes</a> </p><p>[7] <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/Bus_Pirate">Bus Pirate - flashrom</a> </p><p>[8] <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/ISP">ISP - flashrom</a> </p><p>[9] <a href="https://github.com/devttys0/sasquatch">GitHub - devttys0/sasquatch</a> </p><p>[10] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS">SquashFS - Wikipedia</a> </p><p>[11] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file">Device file</a> </p><p>[12] <a href="https://squashfs-lzma.org/">Official Squashfs LZMA</a> </p><p>[13] <a href="http://www.netis-systems.com/Suppory/gpl.html">Netis GPL Code</a> </p><p>[14] <a href="https://github.com/electricant/netis-wf2419-router-hacking/blob/master/firmware.extracted_new/mkimg.sh">mkimg.sh on GitHub</a> </p><p>[15] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buildroot">Buildroot - Wikipedia</a> </p><p>[16] <a href="https://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/Lexra">Lexra - LinuxMIPS</a> </p>
