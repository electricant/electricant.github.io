<h1>Netis WF2419I Router Hacking Diary</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>I had an old (2014-ish) Netis WF2419I <a href="http://www.netis-systems.com/Suppory/de_details/id/1/de/181.html">[1]</a> router collecting dust in a cabinet at home. Its performance has always been lackluster with the WiFi connection dropping and restarting every few minutes. I bought it to serve as a guest AP for my dorm while I was studying in Padova. After I moved I've never used it any more and switched to a whole different setup (which I hope to describe in another post). </p><p>This router was almost forgotten, until I read an excellent article by George Hilliard <a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/05/hacking-reolink-cameras-for-fun-and-profit/">[2]</a> about hacking Reolink cameras. This was enough to spark my interest in trying to reverse engineer and add as much new functionality as possible to this old (and somewhat crappy) piece of hardware. </p><p>First off let's set some goals to keep us on track: </p><ul><li>Open the router and identify chipset, RAM, FLASH size and serial port</li><li>Dump the flash contents and inspect them</li><li>Rebuild a bootable image from the extracted contents and flash it</li><li>Setup a working buildroot image and compile a statically-linked busybox</li><li>Compile a (hopefully working) custom kernel for the device</li></ul><p>As you can see some of those goals are not easy. Moreover, Murphy's law gets you every time and many roadblocks were encountered during this journey. I will not spare any of the details, including the <strong>MANY</strong> failed attempts. That's why I'm calling this page a diary. </p><p>At the time of writing I'm quite far from completion. Depending how long this grows I might decide to split this post into a series. </p><h2>Opening up the Device &amp; Talking to the Serial Port</h2><p>This is the easy part. Just remove the two screws on the bottom side (one is hidden by the mandatory 'warranty void if seal is broken' sticker, about which I couldn't care less) and pop open the case. </p><p>The following components appear before us onto the sea of green of the board: </p><ul><li>Realtek RTL8196C - the main router chipset</li><li>Realtek RTL8192CE - WiFi chipset</li><li>Winbond W25Q32FV - 32Mbit (4MB) SPI FLASH memory</li><li>ESMT M12L128168A - 2M x 16 Bit x 4 Banks (16MB) SDRAM</li><li>A few test points, probably for JTAG and UART access</li></ul><p>As a first step let's look up on our favourite search engine for the main router chipset datasheet. And sure enough somebody (thank you!) released a confidential copy for us to read <a href="https://lost-contact.mit.edu/afs/sur5r.net/service/drivers+doc/Realtek/RTL8196C%20Datasheet.pdf">[3]</a>. Let's neglect all the other details for the moment and scroll right-ahead to the pinout. Remember we are looking for a serial port. </p><p><figure> 	<a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/chipset_pinout.png">  		<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/chipset_pinout.png"/>  	</a>  	<figcaption> Realtek RTL8196C chipset pinout.</figcaption>  </figure>  </p><p>And sure enough here it is! Look at the above picture. In the bottom-right part we have two pins (pin 36 and 37) labelled <tt> UART_RX/GPIOA7</tt>  and <tt> UART_TX/GPIOB0</tt> . With a multimeter those two pins are tracked to the unpopulated header labelled <tt> J1</tt> . Time to solder a pin header and connect a TTL to USB adapter. But HEI! Wait! What's the baud rate? A quick check with an oscilloscope (some trial and error works too) revealed it's <tt> 38400bps</tt> . </p><p><figure> 	<a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/pin_header.jpg">  		<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/pin_header.jpg"/>  	</a>  	<figcaption> Pin header soldered to <tt> J1</tt> .</figcaption>  </figure>  </p><p>After connecting a TTL to serial adapter and issuing </p><pre><code>$ screen -L /dev/ttyUSB0 38400 </code></pre><p>When we start the router we get the following messages: </p><pre><code>=============================

	BusyBox is a multi-call binary that combines many common Unix  
	utilities into a single executable.  Most people will create a  
	link to busybox for each function they wish to use, and BusyBox  
	will act like whatever it was invoked as.

Isn't it? </p><p>Now that we have grabbed some basic information about the system let's move on and see what we obtain by dumping the contents of the flash. </p><h2>Dumping The Flash Contents</h2><p>The flash chip was already identified by visual inspection to be a Winbond W25Q32FV chip. Time to download its datasheet <a href="https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25q32fv%20revi%2010202015.pdf">[4]</a> to get the pinout and connect it to our beloved Bus Pirate <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate">[5]</a>. </p><p><figure> 	<a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_pinout.gif">  		<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_pinout.gif"/>  	</a>  	<figcaption> Winbond W25Q32FV flash chip pinout.</figcaption>  </figure>  </p><p>Now that we know the pinout let's figure out how to connect the chip for using <tt> flashrom</tt>  <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/Bus_Pirate">[6]</a> on it. I'll try In-System Programming (ISP) <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/ISP">[7]</a> first since it is much quicker. If this won't work the only solution is to desolder and resolder the flash chip from the board every time we have to read or program it. This is time consuming and I'd like to avoid it at all cost. </p><p>A quick reverse engineering of the traces around the chip revealed that pin 3 and pin 7 (<tt> /WP</tt>  and <tt> /HOLD</tt>  respectively) which, according to <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/Bus_Pirate">[6]</a> should be connected to 3.3V on the bus pirate, are already tied to the VCC pin (pin 8). Therefore, only 6 out of 8 wires have to be connected. </p><p>Let's get back to our trusty soldering iron. Twenty minutes later, with a piece of an old ATA cable (the 80-wire version which uses smaller conductors) we have a nice little connector ready to be plugged into the Bus Pirate socket. </p><p><figure> 	<a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_buspirate.jpg">  		<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_buspirate.jpg"/>  	</a>  	<figcaption> Bus Pirate ISP connection to the flash chip.</figcaption>  </figure>  </p><p>To check for a successful connection the following command was issued: </p><pre><code>$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=2M  
[sudo] password for pol:  
flashrom v1.2 on Linux 5.7.0-2-amd64 (x86_64)

Found Winbond flash chip "W25Q32.V" (4096 kB, SPI) on buspirate_spi.

Time to dump its contents. </p><pre><code>$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=2M -r firmware_orig.bin </code></pre><p>Let's now extract the contents of the dump recursively to see what's inside. At the end of the process we should have a folder named <tt> _firmware_orig.bin.extracted</tt> . </p><pre><code>$ binwalk -e firmware_orig.bin

What is going on? I decided to tackle one issue at a time. </p><p>First of all is the squashfs file system backwards-compatible? Apparently SquashFS v4.0 moved to a fixed little-endian format (even for big-endian systems). The odds of the new image booting are already quite low. For the sake of science I decided to find it out the hard way. </p><pre><code>$ cp ../firmware_orig.bin firmware_pwned.bin

$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=2M -w firmware.extracted_new/firmware_pwned.bin </code></pre><p>And sure enough when the router is turned on it is stuck in a bootloop unable to mount the root file system. </p><h3>The Hard Way</h3><p>Of course it cannot be so easy. Can we install a different version of squashfs-tools from the Debian repos? Of course not. We have to compile our own. The first thing I did was to download from sourceforge <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/squashfs/files/squashfs">[9]</a> the squashfs sources for version 2.2-r2. Due to different gcc behaviour and different header files, to get this squashfs-tools version compile on my system the following changes need to be applied: </p><pre><code>$ diff -u squashfs2.2-r2/squashfs-tools squashfs-tools

Of course nothing will boot! Binwalk did not have the required permissions to create them. We have to extract the file system as root: </p><pre><code>$ sudo sasquatch D0000.squashfs

However, the router is still stuck in a bootloop. A quick check to the size of the final flash image size confirms that the new image is not too big to fit in the flash chip. What is still missing is the correct compression algorithm. By looking at the output above we see that lzma-adaptive compression was detected. Version 2.2 of mksquashfs does not support lzma compression by default. A working copy of squashfs-lzma <a href="https://squashfs-lzma.org/">[10]</a> is needed. But I was fed up of blindly trying stuff until something works, so I downloaded the GPL code <a href="http://www.netis-systems.com/Suppory/gpl.html">[11]</a> (thanks Richard Stallman) for my router model and started inspecting the package contents to find some clues about how the flash image is built. </p><h3>GPL Code is Fun</h3><p>Inside the package the directory <tt> GPL_Code_RTL/rtl819x-sdk-v1.2/AP/squashfs-tools</tt>  is found. After copying it somewhere else, the code inside such directory was patched in a similar fashion as SquashFS 2.2-r2. </p><pre><code>$ diff -ru squashfs-tools-orig squashfs-tools/
