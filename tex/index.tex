\maketitle
\quote{``Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.'' (\emph{William Wordsworth}, preface to Lyrical Ballads)}
\\*\\*
Despite the quotation, I do not think of myself as a poet, neither do I aim at becoming one.
This website is simply a cluttered recollection of anything interesting and maybe worthwile.
\\*And of course it's done in tranqullity and with deep thougt. That's why Wordsworth's definition of poetry seemed appropriate.
\\*This webside is mainly intended as a personal reference. Anyway I'll try to briefly comment each article linked here. Doing so will help me remember why each entry is listed here and (I hope) help you decide what to read and what to skip.
\\*Keep in mind that you may find something in italian (I's my mother tongue).
\\*Finally I kindly ask you to donate to \url{http://www.autistici.org} they are hosting this website and fight for the open web!
\\*By the way, if you have anything you'd like to tell me feel free to write to \href{mailto:electricant@anche.no}{electricant@anche.no}
\\*That's all. Enjoy!

\section{Things I Fiddle With}
My interests are mainly electronics, programming and technology in general. 
\\*So here's a list of projects whith their links:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Practically everything related to programming is here:
                  \href{http://github.com/electricant}{GitHub}
      \item \href{ultimatema.html}{Ultimate Machine}
      \item A humble Operating System (dubbed \href{OS.html}{ElectrOS})
      \item This website! It's written entirely using \LaTeX{} and rendered to HTML using \texttt{htlatex}.
      (Actually some Makefile magic is involved too but it's just tweaks).
      You can get the sources with \texttt{`wget --mirror --no-parent --reject="*.html*" www.autistici.org/electricant/'}
      \item GNU/Linux:
      \begin{itemize}
            \item \href{other/rc.local}{Here} is my \texttt{/etc/rc.local} script.
            \item Useful update script for Debian-based OSs \href{other/update}{update}
      \end{itemize}

\section{Quotes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ``If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would
	appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till
	he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.''
	\\*(\emph{William Blake}, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell)
	
	\item ``Prisons are built whith stones of Law, Brothels whith bricks of
	Religion. [\ldots] As the caterpillar chooses the fairest leaves to lay
	her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys.''
	\\*(\emph{William Blake}, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell)
	
	\item ``Leith dreamily surveyed the long ash of his cigar and turned to 
	me. "Do you know, Anak, you can't appreciate the joy of being the
	buffoon, playing the clown. You couldn't do it if you wished.
	Your pitiful little conventions and smug assumptions of decency would
	prevent. But simply to turn loose your soul to every whimsicality,
	to play the fool unafraid of any possible result, why, that requires a
	man other than a householder and law-respecting citizen.''
	\\*(\emph{Jack London}, Moon Face: Local Color)
	
	\item ``LSD was an incredible experience. Not that I’m recommending it
	for anybody else; but for me it kind of – it hammeced home to me that
	reality was not a fixed thing. That the reality that we saw about us
	every day was one reality, and a valid one – but that there were 
	others, different perspectives where different things have meaning that
	were just as valid. That had a profound effect on me.''
	\\*(\emph{Alan Moore})
	
	\item ``Wouldn't you like to see a positive LSD story on the news?
	To base your decision on information rather than scare tactics and
	superstition? Perhaps? Wouldn't that be interesting? Just for once?
	\\*Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy
	condensed to a slow vibration – that we are all one consciousness
	experiencing itself subjectively. There's no such thing as death, life
	is only a dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves.
	\\*Here's Tom with the weather.''
	\\*(\emph{Bill Hicks}, Sane Man -1989-, \href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D0BeLz5blM}{video})
