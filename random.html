It's the last privilege of a free mind</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newint.org/columns/essays/2016/04/01/psycho-spiritual-crisis/">The demoralized mind</a><br/> Essay about how our consumerism culture relates to depression and demoralization. </p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/extreme-meritocracy/505358/">Living in an Extreme Meritocracy is Exhausting</a><br/> The consequence of algoritm abuse. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/why-time-management-is-ruining-our-lives">Why time management is ruining our lives</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/like-start-ups-most-intentional-communities-fail-why">Like start-ups, most intentional communities fail – why? | Aeon Essays</a> <br> A great essay highlighting difficulties most intentional communities fail. All in all <em>"communities are just fractals of society"</em>. </p></li><li><p><a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/better-than-fre">Better Than Free</a> <br>  Article by Kevin Kelly. It points out how the internet is a copy machine that has made many things worthless and for what the people is still willing to pay. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-cult-leaders-brainwash-followers-for-total-control">How totalism works</a> <br>  <em>"The brainwashing methods of isolation, engulfment and fear can lead anyone  to a cult."</em> </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/jul/17/neoliberalism-has-conned-us-into-fighting-climate-change-as-individuals">Neoliberalism has conned us into fighting climate change as individuals</a> <br>  <em>"This is the con-job of neoliberalism: to persuade us to address climate  change through our pocket-books, rather than through power and politics."</em> <br>  Also on the same line: <a href="https://qz.com/920561/conscious-consumerism-is-a-lie-heres-a-better-way-to-help-save-the-world/">Conscious consumerism is a lie. Here’s a better way to help save the world</a> </p></li><li><p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-subalterns-are-speaking-whos-listening">Law in the Jungle</a> <br>   Essay on the Jungle refugee camp in Calais.

If they can’t control information, crime, businesses, borders or the money supply, then they will cease to deliver what citizens demand of them. In the end, nation-states are nothing but agreed-upon myths: we give up certain freedoms in order to secure others. But if that transaction no longer works, and we stop agreeing on the myth, it ceases to have power over us."</em> </p></li><li><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2013/09/04/medieval-peasants-got-a-lot-more-vacation-time-than-you-economist/">Medieval Peasants Got a Lot More Vacation Time Than You</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/universal-basic-income-is-a-neoliberal-plot-to-make-you-poorer/">Universal Basic Income is a neoliberal plot to make you poorer</a> <br>  <em>"A closer look at how UBI is expected to work reveals that it is intended to provide political cover for the elimination of social programs and the privatization of social services"</em> </p></li><li><p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-pop-culture-obsessed-with-battles-between-good-and-evil">The good guy/bad guy myth</a> <br>  <em>"Good guy/bad guy narratives might not possess any moral sophistication, but they do promote social stability, and they’re useful for getting people to sign up for armies and fight in wars with other nations. Their values feel like morality, and the association with folklore and mythology lends them a patina of legitimacy, but still, they don’t arise from a moral vision. They are rooted instead in a political vision, which is why they don’t help us deliberate, or think more deeply about the meanings of our actions."</em> </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/how-to-get-rich">How to Get Rich</a> <br/> The title is kind of a clickbait. This is a talk by Jared Diamond, author of <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em>. It is a summary of his book. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://slightlymarxistfounder.com/2018/03/10/fitter-happier-more-productive/">Fitter, Happier, More Productive… and other fantasies of millennial life</a> <br/><em>"Radiohead’s OK Computer is turning 21 this year (2018).

And as anyone in any field understands, when there’s way more qualified applicants than jobs, the existing jobs can demand more of applicants (more qualifications, less money) while applicants lower their own expectations (for compensation, for benefits, for job security, for course load and service, for location)."</em> </p></li><li><p><a href="http://ursulakleguin.com/LeftHandMillsCollege.html">Ursula K.

Gasoline would cost way more than $10 a gallon."</em> </p></li><li><p><a href="http://unevenearth.org/2018/08/the-social-ideology-of-the-motorcar/">The Social Ideology of the Motorcar</a> <br/><em>"This 1973 essay on how cars have taken over our cities remains as relevant as ever"</em> </p></li></ul><h3>Relationships</h3><p>Lately I have become more intrested in relationship-related essays.
