This is a list of things I'm up to now:

* Learning functional programming and AI
* Create things both hardware and software
* Blog about things I create and about interesting stuff
* Finishing my last year at university hoping to get a PhD afterwards
* I'm really into swimming and scuba diving.
* I love tasting craft beers (expecially english ales).
