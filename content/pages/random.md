# Random Stuff

This page collects some links to interesting things I found while surfing the
net. The order is random, the goal is to put the most recent things first and
group stuff by topic but don't take it for granted. I try to add a small comment
after each link in order to provide some context about it.

## Articles <a name="articles"></a>

* [Out of the Wild](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/out-of-the-wild)
    <br/>Wonderful article about the human tendency to position themselves as
    protectors of the natural order. This is based on a idealized notion of the
    wild which does not actually belong to nature. I enjoyed learning that
    humpback whales show a simiar behavior: they sometimes protect seals from
    killer whales.

	thinking with a critique of social media as a bonus.

	<br/>Three-part history on the transistor. Very well written and
	instructive.

* [Drowning Doesn’t Look Like Drowning](http://mariovittone.com/2010/05/154/)
	<br/>People drowning don't behave like in the movies.

* [If correlation doesn't imply causation, then what does?](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/if-correlation-doesnt-imply-causation-then-what-does)
	<br/>Some theory about the difference between correlation and causation.
	Insightful.

* [Boredom is not a problem to be solved. It's the last privilege of a free mind](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/28/boredom-cures-privilege-free-mind)

* [How totalism works](https://aeon.co/essays/how-cult-leaders-brainwash-followers-for-total-control) <br>

* [How to Get Rich](https://www.edge.org/conversation/how-to-get-rich)

	thought.

* [A Hidden Order of Reality](http://bostonreview.net/philosophy-religion-literature-culture/gili-kliger-hidden-order-reality)
	<br/>Article about the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss.
	<br/>*"No amount of conviction in my freedom can unburden me of the
	structures that impose their contours on daily existence. And that
	studying the way those structures operate —in our schools, through our
	prison system, in what we see when we turn on the television— constituted
	the first step in combatting the awesome reaches of their power."*

### Society <a name="society"></a>

* [The idea of primitive communism is as seductive as it is wrong](https://aeon.co/essays/the-idea-of-primitive-communism-is-as-seductive-as-it-is-wrong)
	<br/>It's important to challenge our own assumptions from time to time.
	This article does just that by demistifying the idea that societies were
	naturally egalitarian and communal before farming.

* [Littlewood’s Law and the Global Media](https://www.gwern.net/Littlewood)
	<br/>Littlewood's law states that *"In the course of any normal person’s
	life, miracles happen at a rate of roughly one per month"*. This means
	that most of the time sensational news reported in the media is not
	representative of an actual trend.

* [Ours is the Waste Age: that’s the key to transforming the future](https://aeon.co/essays/ours-is-the-waste-age-thats-the-key-to-tranforming-the-future)

* [Three Theories for Why You Have No Time](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/why-you-never-have-time/603937/)
	<br/>*"Better technology means higher expectations, and higher
	expectations create more work."* To leave a meaningful life one has to
	keep an eye on his/her expectations.

* [Angels in the Market](https://aeon.co/essays/from-home-to-market-a-history-of-white-womens-power-in-the-us)
	<br/>The heart-tug tactics of 1950s ads steered white American women away
	from activism into domesticity. They’re still there.

* [In a pandemic we learn again what Sartre meant by being free](https://psyche.co/ideas/in-a-pandemic-we-learn-again-what-sartre-meant-by-being-free)

* [Finances, Technology, Repair, and "Enough"](https://syonyk.blogspot.com/2020/02/finances-technology-repair-and-enough.html)

* [How do people learn to cook a poisonous plant safely?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48859333)<br/>
	Intresting comparison between the development of culture and the
	scientific method. However I do not fully agree with the article since
	science, the same way as our culture, develops by emulation and
	improvement on previous results by other people.

* [The demoralized mind](https://newint.org/columns/essays/2016/04/01/psycho-spiritual-crisis/)<br/>
	Essay about how our consumerism culture relates to depression and
	demoralization.

* [Like start-ups, most intentional communities fail – why? | Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/like-start-ups-most-intentional-communities-fail-why)
	<br/>A great essay highlighting difficulties most intentional communities
	fail. All in all *"communities are just fractals of society"*.

* [Better Than Free](http://kk.org/thetechnium/better-than-fre) <br/>
	Article by Kevin Kelly. It points out how the internet is a copy machine
	that has made many things worthless and for what the people is still
	willing to pay.

* [Neoliberalism has conned us into fighting climate change as individuals](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/jul/17/neoliberalism-has-conned-us-into-fighting-climate-change-as-individuals)
	<br/> *"This is the con-job of neoliberalism: to persuade us to address
	climate change through our pocket-books, rather than through power and
	politics."*
	<br> Also on the same line: [Conscious consumerism is a lie.  Here’s a better way to help save the world](https://qz.com/920561/conscious-consumerism-is-a-lie-heres-a-better-way-to-help-save-the-world/)
	
* [Return of the city-state](https://aeon.co/essays/the-end-of-a-world-of-nation-states-may-be-upon-us) <br/>
	*"This is the crux of the problem: nation-states rely on control. If they
	can’t control information, crime, businesses, borders or the money supply,
	then they will cease to deliver what citizens demand of them. In the end,
	nation-states are nothing but agreed-upon myths: we give up certain
	freedoms in order to secure others."*

* [Universal Basic Income is a neoliberal plot to make you poorer](https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/universal-basic-income-is-a-neoliberal-plot-to-make-you-poorer/) <br/>
	*"A closer look at how UBI is expected to work reveals that it is intended
	to provide political cover for the elimination of social programs and the
	privatization of social services"*

	<br/>*"Radiohead’s OK Computer is turning 21 this year (2018). The album
	has enjoyed a renaissance of late, finding more relevance in a tech
	addicted society."*

* [Radical Critique of Wellness Culture](https://newrepublic.com/article/148296/barbara-ehrenreich-radical-crtique-wellness-culture)
	<br/>Essay about the fear of death typical of contemporary society.

* [Die Like a Dog](https://aeon.co/essays/why-do-we-give-dogs-a-better-death-than-we-give-ourselves)
	<br/>Pet dogs often have a peaceful death that forestalls protracted
	suffering and pain. Why can’t we do the same for humans? (see also the
	article above)

* [Orwell knew: we willingly buy the screens that are used against us](https://aeon.co/ideas/orwell-knew-we-willingly-buy-the-screens-that-are-used-against-us)

* [Paradise Lost?—The iron cage of consumerism](https://timjackson.org.uk/consumerism-theodicy/)
	<br/>*"Far from creating a credible eschatology, consumerism appears to be
	a continuous exercise in denial of our own mortality and of the widespread
	suffering in the world."* <br/>*"we might usefully conclude, countering
	consumerism must start from more robust secular (or religious) theodicy:
	the building of meaning structures, communities of meaning, that lie
	outside the realm of the market; and that offer credible answers to the
	deep foundational questions that continue to haunt us."*

* [Why did men stop wearing high heels, anyway?](https://qz.com/409254/why-did-men-stop-wearing-high-heels-anyway/)

### Work related <a name="work-related"></a>

* [Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)
	<br/>Intresting, albeit cinical view of why companies hire engineers.
	<br/>*"Engineers are hired to create business value, not to program
	things: Businesses do things for irrational and political reasons all the
	time, but in the main they converge on doing things which increase
	revenue or reduce costs."* 

* [How the work ethic became a substitute for good jobs](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-approach-the-lifelong-project-of-language-learning)

* [Is Everything a MLM (Multi Level Marketing scheme)](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/is-everything-an-mlm)
	<br/>Critical article about PhD and academic jobs in general.
	<br/> *"too many people coming through grad school, and too few
	sustainable academic jobs. And as anyone in any field understands, when
	there’s way more qualified applicants than jobs, the existing jobs can
	demand more of applicants (more qualifications, less money) while
	applicants lower their own expectations (for compensation, for benefits,
	for job security, for course load and service, for location)."*

* [Medieval Peasants Got a Lot More Vacation Time Than You](https://nypost.com/2013/09/04/medieval-peasants-got-a-lot-more-vacation-time-than-you-economist/)

### Car and traffic related <a name="car-and-traffic"></a>

This is a list of articles on such topic.

	*"If the price of gasoline and the vehicles that burn it actually
	reflected the true costs and damage they inflict, the common car would go
	extinct.  Gasoline would cost way more than $10 a gallon."*

* [The Social Ideology of the Motorcar](http://unevenearth.org/2018/08/the-social-ideology-of-the-motorcar/)

	short primer on Buddhism.

	potential as a human, and engaging with others – family, friends and
	fellow citizens – in mutually beneficial activities."*
